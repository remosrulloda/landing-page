                    <p>Jason Todd, also known as the Red Hood, is a complex and formidable character in the DC Comics
                        universe. <br><br> Originally introduced as the second Robin, Jason's journey is marked by

                        conventional boundaries of heroism. With his edgy and uncompromising approach, the Red Hood
                        embodies
                        a morally gray perspective, often challenging the traditional ideals of the Batman family.

                        navigating a world of darkness and vengeance.

                        the
                        biological son of Bruce Wayne (Batman) and Talia al Ghul, Damian possesses a unique blend of
                        genetics
                        and upbringing. Trained by the League of Assassins from an early age, Damian is a prodigious
